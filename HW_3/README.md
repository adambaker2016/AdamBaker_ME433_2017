### Gerber Files for Circuit Board Design adn Production

<p> This folder contains the completed custom design for a PIC32 and the associated Gerber files necessary to manufacture this design. </p>

<p> The circuit board's purpose is to integrate the PIC32 with specific parts to aid in a final project of an autonomous cart </p>

<p> This design includes the following parts:
  <ul>
    <li>A USB Port for communicating with an Android phone</li>
    <li>An external clock for improved accuracy in USB communication </li>
    <li>A push button for reseting the PIC32 attached to an LED indicator </li>
    <li>A switch to turn off or turn on power from the USB </li>
    <li>A device to change the voltage from 5V to 3.3V from the USB to the PIC</li>
    <li>Additional capacitors and resistors to provide adequate electrical connection </li>
    <li>Header Pins to provide access to the PIC32's various functional pins</li>
  </ul>
